# React TypeScript Starter Repo

Hello! This repository has been pre-configured with eslint and gh-pages to automatically deploy your app when you push to the main branch.

## For grader:

Make sure to run `npm i` at first, since node_modules is ignored by default.

This repo didn't come with a prettier file so some stuff might not conform with the prettier standards for the other tasks repo.
